## Description

This is my personal web developer portfolio page. The site contains sections to tell the viewer more about me, provides them with the opportunity to view and download my portfolio, displays a carousel presentation of recent projects and has a *fully operational* contact me page.

The website was built in `React`. Additonal dependencies include `React Bootstrap` and `emailjs`.

## Installation

No installation is needed, as this is a purely front-end application. 

## Usage

Here is a GIF demonstrating functionality:
